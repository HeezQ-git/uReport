Reporting system for minecraft servers based on the Skript language

**Skript** is a plugin that allows you to customize Minecraft's mechanics with simple scripts written in plain English sentences.
More information can be found here: https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases

**! NOTE**

This is an unfinished project from 2020,
the project was created from scratch by me and is for public viewing.
**The code is not complete and may contain errors due to abandonment.**

The project was intended to be even more extensive. **Currently you can find there:**
- Possibility to install the script using the installer, which downloads the content itself and carries out the installation automatically.
- Automatic downloading of updates
- Config
- Language manager - possibility to create own language pack
- Logs and backups
- Possibility to reinstall a script from the menu level
- Ability to uninstall a script from the menu level
- Time zone change capability
- Extended "help" command in the form of a chat menu
- Changing permissions and managing access to content at will
- Interactive FAQ section with search engine for questions and their answers
- Config management menu from the game level (via menu)
- Creation of new issues and their easy and seamless management
- Possibilities for the administrator: transfer of leadership, change of state, deletion, change of priority and type of issue, teleportation to the player, giving him a warning, blocking the ability to add new reports.
- Possibilities for the player: detailed check of the status of the issue, request for removal of the report, adding attachments (whitelist of available websites), adding a description, setting the type of the issue. A player can report another player, a bug, a payment problem and any other problem that is not listed.
- Issue history -> every move is recorded in the player's logs.
- Private chat between the administrator and the player, working on an anonymous basis (nobody can see the chat except for the server owner and correspondents)
